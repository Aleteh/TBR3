TBR 3 (1.36)

This will be the first version of The Black Road for Dota 2

It will be a close copy of the 1.36b version of the Wc3 game. (Quality of life improvements are of course necessary)

This will serve as a base game while work on the 1.4 concepts are being done.


Art

Materials are still in high demand
	- Plaster'ish walls
	- Stone walls
	- Wood beams
	- Old cement
	- Windows
	- and more

Map is taking shape and is playable
Map needs spawners and waypoints
Titan gates need implementation
Detailing detailing detailing polish detailing and more polish

Code

Boss and Titan abilities are missing
Bosses and Titans should not be able to be stun locked or mana drained unless its part of the boss fight mechanics for a specific encounter
Stats-RPG for saving and loading characters

UI

Bank or Expanded player inventory
	- Finally getting the level and currency to get the bank in the original was a nice acheivement, so if we go for more player inventory, we should try and replicate that feeling

Quest Log UI (arhowk) needs to be more minimalistic. Right now it takes up a third of the screenspace. 
It also needs to be changed to be toggleable by clicking on the quest NPCs and not be vicinity based as quest NPCs move and fight with you, causing the Quest Log window to pop in and out when you are near.

	- Quests needs to be added (there are examples vscripts/quest)


Crafting system and UI

Custom Itemshop UI

Clean up Dota2 UI clutter.
