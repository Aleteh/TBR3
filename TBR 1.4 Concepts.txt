Classes
Harpy Magi
Primary - Downdraft
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates a relentless current of air on a target. When cast on an enemy, small high pressure gusts, that carry negative energies and debris, will cut and tear at them dealing damage and slowing them slightly for 20 seconds. When self-cast, the Harpy Magi will receive a boost to health and mana recovery for 10 seconds. When cast on an ally, the caster and the target will receive half of the total health and mana recovery for 10 seconds. When Downdraft is self-cast, the strength of the ability may slow the caster depending on the percentage of maximum health missing.
Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing
Cooldown: 10 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average

Notes:
• A decent single target DPS ability with a small slow effect. One of the few abilities that can regenerate mana, but should be used carefully; when self-cast the potency of the ability can slow the movement of the Harpy Magi if she's weakened.
• The health and mana regeneration is affected by Spell Healing in a similar way Valor is.

Secondary - Wind Shear
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates a rush of supersonic air downward on an enemy dealing damage and slowing the enemy's movement for 5 seconds. If Downdraft is active on the enemy when Wind Shear is cast, then they suffer increased damage and slowed attack speed as well.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 15 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average

Notes:
• An effective single target damage ability with a slow effect

Tertiary - Thunderclap
Effect: You call a bolt of lightning at a targeted location dealing damage in a 450 radius with heavier damage to units closer to the point of impact. Enemies within 200 units of the impact will be immobilized (if possible without stuns), and will be electrically charged. Electrically charged enemies suffer shock damage, and will create chain lightning feedback against themselves if they attack a hero in melee, for 5 seconds. Enemies between 201 and 450 units will only suffer the shock damage.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average

Notes:
• An AoE-focused damaging ability that has defensive utility immobilizing (or slowing otherwise) enemies.

Journeyman 1 - Voltaic Cyclone
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates an electrical storm focused on a targeted point. Seven voltaic orbs are created 600 units from the targeted point and, over several seconds, whirlpool centripetally towards it. Enemies struck by the orbs will take damage, while allies struck by the orbs will receive healing. When the orbs reach the center, they'll crash together dealing a large amount of damage at the point of impact. Enemies suffering from shock damage will take increased damage from the orbs.
Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing
Cooldown: 25 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average-High

Notes:
• A decent AoE damage/heal ability, with high single target damage. As the spell does not target a specific enemy it can miss easily if not used carefully.
• While not as easy to use a directed heals, the ability for a player to be struck many times during the spell (runs towards the center as the orbs travel) can make it extremely effective.

Journeyman 2 - Storm Shield (Channeled)
Effect: The Harpy Magi channels lightning towards all nearby allies creating a blanket of electricity around them. While the spell is channeling (and for an equal amount of time after the channeling has ended) heroes within range will receive reduced physical and magical damage, as well as increased attack damage and spell power. Can be channeled for up to 10 seconds. (Channeling cannot be broken by enemy stuns.)
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: High

Notes:
• If the Harpy Magi channels the ability for 5 seconds and then has to cancel it to move, players receive the buff for the duration of the channeling and then 5 seconds afterwards. This means that it can be channeled a maximum of 10 seconds, and last another 10 seconds for a total of 20 seconds.

Ultimate 1 - Inclemency
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates a swirling vortex that deals constant damage to all enemies nearby. The storm follows the caster for 30 seconds damaging enemies every second, and slowing their movement speed based on their missing health. Enemies with Downdraft take significantly more damage and slow. Allies with Downdraft receive more health regeneration and receive no movement reduction.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 500
Cost: High

Notes:
• A very effective AoE that can still be useful on single targets, and can provide some healing bonus, using Downdraft

Ultimate 2 - Ascension
Effect: The Harpy Magi lifts off of the ground and dives in a targeted direction damaging enemies in her path. While in the air the Harpy Magi is considered a flying unit, and is therefore immune to attacks and abilities that cannot target flying units. When the Harpy Magi reaches her destination she will hover in the air as a flying unit for 5 seconds before landing allowing the use of movement, attacking, and abilities as well as receiving increased Spell Power while in the air.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: High

Notes:
• A decent damage charge attack with the invaluable movement utility and a nice bonus to spell power

Class Skill - Gift Of The Elements
Effect: The Harpy Magi also receives 2 Spell Power per Strength, and 1 Spell Power per Agility.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• While Harpy Magi's still lose out on the Mana, Mana Regeneration and Attack Damage from Int, they can get a little more of the other stats without as much detriment to their abilities.

Class Notes:
• Designed to be an experimental, somewhat difficult to master, Caster DPS/Healer hybrid
• With proper use of abilities and tactics, the Harpy Magi can balance DPS and Healing very effectively

Champion of the Arena (Rough Draft)
Primary – Crushing Grip
Effect: The Champion and his target are immobilized. The Champion will continue to attack normally, but will also deal damage for the duration equal to: (Hero Damage + 2*Str) / (Current Attack Speed) per second. If either is moved by any effect, then the ability ends. Cast again to manually cancel the effect. The spell lasts a maximum of 10 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: Melee 
Cost: Average

Notes:
• A single target attack that immobilizes an enemy and scales well with both Str and Agi, as it takes Attack Speed, Hero Damage and Strength into account.

Secondary – Reckless Advance
Effects: The Champion rushes through enemies in a furious headlong charge. He will deal Agility-based damage to every enemy he hits, as well as taking 5% of maximum health damage himself per target. Twice the amount of health lost is added to the damage of the ability.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 25 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• Because the damage scales with both Agility AND maximum health, it can benefit from both Str and Agi builds.
• Can be used to escape melee or quickly enter it

Tertiary – Inspiration in War
Effects: If the Champion engages in combat for long enough, he will release a battle cry inspiring allies. Every second that the Champion either deals or receives damage, he gains a charge. After 20 charges have been gained, the Champion will automatically release his battle cry buffing the stats of nearby allies by 5% for 20 seconds. Charges will decay one per second if the Champion is out of combat for 10 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: 650 
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• While not an overly powerful skill it’s casted automatically without cost, buffs stats by % so it scales with any build, and applies to all allies in range making it increasingly useful in larger groups

Journeyman 1 – Herculean Roar (Channeled)
Effects: The Champion summons all the force inside himself and releases a long roar. Enemies within range suffer from reduced attack damage and increased damage taken while the ability is channelled, as well as for an equal amount of time after the channelling has ended. Allies in range are cleared of debuffs when the ability is cast. Can only be channelled for 10 seconds. (Channeling cannot be broken by enemy stuns.)
Benefits From: N/A

If an enemy is targeted, or is within 100 units of a targeted ally, the Champion will land on the enemy dealing high damage and immobilizing them for 5 seconds. Targeted allies will also receive a 2 second damage absorbing shield. 
Benefits From: N/A

Range: 600 
Cost: Average

Notes:
• The Champion is able to move quickly to a targeted point and assist an ally in distress

Ultimate 1 – Gladiator’s Salvation

Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: Melee
Cost: Average-High

Notes:
• A powerful single target DPS ability that gives the Champion magic damage.

Ultimate 2 - Invictus
Effect: The Champion gains a passive, static, reduction to damage taken and can additionally activate the ability to ignore the next incoming source of damage (magic or physical).
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• A powerful passive that can also be activated to avoid incoming spike damage. An asset for both tanks and DPS.

Class Skill - Adrenaline
Effects: The Champion has become so accustomed to life and death situations that his body consistently administers adrenaline, and boosts the quantity even more as he suffers. Adrenaline gives the Champion of the Arena increased movement, increasing x2 critical chance, and increased [BASE] health regeneration.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• The exact functioning is as such: Rank 1 gives 3 movement, 3% critical chance and 3% bonus to BASE health regeneration at all times. Every 10% health missing adds a multiplier, so it would be:
(Health) 100-91% = Bonus (3)%, 90-81% = (3x2)%, 80-71% = (3x3)%, 70-61% = (3x4)%, 60-51% = (3x5)%, 50-41% = (3x6)%, 40-31% = (3x7)%, 30-21% = (3x8)%, 20-11% = (3x9)%, 10-0% = (3x10)%
• Adrenaline gets 1% BASE added every 4 ranks, so at Rank 8 it has a minimum of +5/5% bonus, and a maximum of +50/50% bonus. Keep in mind it’s a 50% bonus to the BASE Strength Health Regeneration. This means:
Given a hypothetical value of 0.1 regeneration per point of Strength, 3498 Str would give ~350 regen a second. If the Champion was at 9% health, he would regen ~525 a second. (IE. 175 free regen)

Ranger
Primary - Puncture
Effect: You hit a vital point in the enemies defenses causing them to take static plus Agility damage over time. Agility increases the periodic damage of the effect while decreasing it's length, and Intelligence will increase the length of the effect while decreasing the periodic damage. Targets are slowed while affected by Puncture.
Benefits From: Spell Damage

Effect: You enchant your arrow to deal additional Intelligence-Based damage to the target. The target is debuffed for 1 second, applied before any damage. If the target dies while the debuff is active they explode damaging surrounding enemies for half the base damage of the skill.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 3 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• AoE damage has been nerfed slighty, as only taking half of the base instead of the full base amount. Final numbers will depend on balancing

Journeyman 2 - Poisoned Arrow (Autocastable)
Effect: You coat your arrow in a concentrated poison and fire it deep into the enemy.

Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing

Cost: High

Notes:
• Can be made into a very effective single target damage spell, or a very effective AoE heal. It can also be decent at both with balance
• The range of the AoE heal is cut in half to around 300. It's either that or nerf the healing drastically, and I'd prefer them to be effective tank healers

Benefits From: N/A

Cost: N/A

Notes:
• A nice passive bonus to damage as well as the ability to steal mana every attack

Class Notes:

Cost: N/A

Notes:
• Players revived by Hallowed Ground will have no mana and health equal to: 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%
• As the dead player MUST be in Hallowed Ground for the entire duration, a Templar cannot cast Hallowed Ground then Benediction killing himself and revive himself

Class Notes:

• While the Templars abilities can be used to extreme effect, they can also function extremely poorly if not used with discretion

Class Notes:
• Designed to be effective tanks, and effective DPS with the option of being a hybrid in between and acting as an offtank

BOSSES


Name: The Arachtriarch
Location: North East in Spider Forest
Level: 200
Abilities: Stun Immune, Multishot Poison Attack, Spawns Minions, Massive Stacking AoE Poison Spell, Shriek of the Deep, Single Target Disable. Two Phase Fight.

Phase One: Her attack has a (3) second cooldown, and does static (1000) poison damage a second for 5 seconds. She will often cast "Silk Rush" on her current target, where she charges into melee with them stunning them, dealing damage based on how many stacks of poison they have, wrapping them in a cacoon, and moving on to a new target. While the target is in a cacoon they are untargetable by spells or attacks, stunned and take static damage every second. The effect lasts until the cacoon is destroyed or the player dies. If a player dies to cacoon a small group of spiders will spawn from their corpse. She will occasionally cast "Poison Dispersion" over a very large area that has a long duration, deals 2% max health in damage, and can stack. Both poison effects remain on characters in cacoons. She will also occasionally cast "Shriek of the Deep" slowing the movement speed and attack speed of all players in her area as well as preventing casting for the duration. She will frequently spawn small spiders, stronger than the normal ones in the area, but relatively weak in comparison to her. These spiders will drop items for curing poison effects.

Phase Two: Phase two will begin when Arachtriarch reaches 15% health. She will stop using her main attack and will be immobile, and focus on casting her AoE cloud many times as often, and spawning spiders faster.

Notes:
• If you defeat Arachtriarch without anyone getting 3 stacks of Inhaled Poison or more, there will be increased drops.
• A tank is not entirely necessary for this fight, but it could make it easier to keep her attention in a specific direction. Controlling her main attacks poison will help a lot in reducing damage people are taking as it will multishot unlimited players in front of her. Keep her facing away.
• Her "Poison Dispersion" is her most dangerous ability. One stack will only deal 2% of max health in damage, but several stacks can make this very dangerous. Especially if it's on multiple people at once. Use Antivenom appropriately and work as a group.
• When phase two starts it is a DPS race. You will need to kill her before the group gets too many stacks of (Inhaled Poison) as she will be spamming the ability constantly. Spiders will spawn at an increased rate, but not quite as fast as her poison is cast... so focus on killing her and not on trying to outlast/cure the poison.

Name: Leviathan
Location: Locris Coast
Level: 200
Abilities: Stun Immune, Massive Regeneration, Alternating Resistances, Ricochet Attack, Gains a buff if an Elemental dies nearby, AoE Spell that disables spells for a short period, Aura that prevents reviving and causes powerful minions to spawn from player corpses, Skyward Mortar

Phase One: Leviathan has 75% evasion.

Phase Two: Leviathan has 75% spell reduction.

Both Phases: Leviathan is immobile for the entire fight and spawns directly between the south west island and the coast of Locris, touching both shores due to his size. His main attack has an unlimited Ricochet (though it can only hit a player once per attack), so players will have to space out from eachother. If an elemental dies within a 600 unit range of him he will get a 100% damage buff for a very short duration. He will have an ability resembling "Healspray" that he will cast primarily on high mana heros. It will disable casting for a short duration and deal static damage. He will occasionally cast a spell called "Skyward Mortar". He will launch a projectile into the air that will target land around him randomly. A marker will appear on the ground signalling where it will land, and players will have a short window of time to move out of the way. It will do a static, and unreducible, 25,000 damage. Should a hero die near Leviathan, any secondary forms of revive are disabled, and a Spawn of Leviathan will be created at their corpse that has a high attack damage.

Notes:
• If you can accomplish the fight without a single person dying, or the boss being buffed from an elemental dying, there will be increased drops.

Name: Grand Vanquisher of the Underworld
Location: Undead Area @ Crypt
Level: 200
Abilities: Stun Immune. Has mana in the countless millions and Mana Shield. Many different abilities and effects depending on what phase. Three phase fight.

Phase One: When you attack the boss it starts the phase one timer. For this phase he is immobile and has no standard attack. The boss will use 10% of his max mana to summon a very powerful undead randomly in the area. He will summon another add every 25 seconds UNLESS you kill the minion. If his summon dies before the 25 seconds he will immediately summon a minion and start a new 25 second spell timer. The boss will enter Phase two after 180 seconds regaining all of his mana. To force him into phase three you must kill his adds fast enough to make him summon 10 before the 180 second time limit. He will occasionally cast "Despair" to all players in the area stunning them for a short period and dealing DoT damage for a long duration. A secondary effect to "Despair" is it also deals instant damage determined by 150*(% of each characters max health missing). He will "Empower" his summoned minion occasionally increasing it's attack speed and damage significantly for a very brief period. He will often cast "Grasp of the Underworld" which will root one player and deal DoT damage while they are rooted. His main form of attack is "Disintegrate" where he will "Locks on to X" and cast a beam of light that follows them for a short time dealing massive damage to anyone it moves over.

Phase Two: The boss has re-established his connection to the spirits of the underworld and siphons their energy at an extraordinary rate. The boss recovers 5% of maximum mana per second. If you do incredible damage to him, you can cancel the effect, however it will be very difficult. When the boss reaches 100% mana or his channeling is cancelled, Phase One restarts.

Phase Three: Phase three only happens if you get the boss to 0 mana. In phase three he gains a melee attack and movement, as well as new abilities. He will have zero mana, so he cannot use summons, "Empower" or "Disintegrate". He will still use "Despair" and "Grasp of the Underworld". He will start using "Imminent Defeat" on his current target occasionally, dealing large static damage, knocking them back, removing all buffs and slowing movement and attack speed to minimum for 3 seconds. He'll also use "Kinetic Command" often, placing a damage absorbing shield on him, and at the end of the short duration dealing absorbed damage (based off Divine reduction) back to all players in the area. He is unable to perform any actions while channeling "Kinetic Command".

Notes: 
• The boss is undead, and will summon undead, so all of them will benefit from the Necromancers global aura. While not killing the Necromancer will make the fight harder, the drops will be increased for being able to accomplish this. It is not however recommended people attempt this until they are comfortable killing the boss without any complications.
• The Grand Vanquisher's summons will give large amounts of gold, mats and experience. Farming the minions endlessly can yield incredible returns. Fighting him before level 200 is not recommended however, so gold and mats will be the primary advantage for most people. For those extremely talented groups, farming minions constantly can provide you with levels, gold, and mats faster than any other way.
• It will be strongly recommended two healers are brought to this fight. One for spam healing the tank, and one for HoT'ing the entire group. Players must be kept at relatively high max health or Despair will start doing massive burst damage.
