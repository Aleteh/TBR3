Spawn System Description

When 1 player enters a zone, spawn X mobs (can be a RandomInt(X,Y) for each particular mob) in npc_dota_spawner + RandomVector optional

Unit list should be stored in a table to iterate easier and avoid extra FindUnits

When all players leave a zone, UTIL_Remove all after a delay

	Test that no items/xp/mats are grantes this way, it shouldnt count as a creep killed -> DONE. Works fine.
	It should never Ever delete mobs with people still in the area, so do a double check after the delay to check if they didn't re-enter

Respawning mobs have a passive OnOwnerDied RunScript that starts a timer to spawn a new unit of the same type near the original location

Extra AI can be made for creeps to roam a path, stop folliwing after X range, etc. Default is follow forever
