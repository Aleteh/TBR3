//Primary - Lacerate (Autocastable)
//Effect: Deals static damage to the target. Adds Agility-Based damage for every bleed effect on the target caused by the Assassin.
//Benefits From: N/A
//Cooldown: 4 seconds
//Range: Melee
//Cost: Low

//Notes:
//• Primary damaging ability. Alone it will do low damage, but with self-caused bleeds on the target the damage is doubled, tripled, or quadrupled
//• The assassin should be able to cast this endlessly, as in, they recover mana at the exact rate they use this spell
