I am using python 3.3

So the unit parser is almost complete, all that is left is to distinguish their abilities, 
collision size(?), relationshipclass (i have no idea what this is), and make it slightly cleaner. 
Other than that it is finished. Also, is it DAMAGE_TYPE_PHYSICAL or DAMAGE_TYPE_ArmorPhysical?
