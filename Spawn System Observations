Despawns seem to be after ~10 seconds of leaving the area
Killing an Ogre took 30 seconds to respawn
Killing a Shaman in the Goblins Area 2 took 3 seconds, but when I killed 5 at the same time, they spawned 1 by 1 (different than the current method)
	meaning a system like a thinker for each creature type is present:
		every X seconds, check for the unit counter in the area, if it's less than the max, spawn 1 of that creature
		when 1 creature is killed, substract 1 to the unit counter of the area
		when area is deactivated, stop the thinker?
