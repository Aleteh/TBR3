Despawns seem to be after ~10 seconds of leaving the area
Killing an Ogre took 30 seconds to respawn
Killing a Shaman in the Goblins Area 2 took 3 seconds, but when I killed 5 at the same time, they spawned 1 by 1 (different than the current method)
	meaning a system like a thinker for each creature type is present:
		every X seconds, check for the unit counter in the area, if it's less than the max, spawn 1 of that creature
		when 1 creature is killed, substract 1 to the unit counter of the area
		when area is deactivated, stop the thinker?

Waves attacking the city
	General observations
		The normal creeps are not changing depending on single levels, they get upgraded to different mobs at certain levels (example: average hero level = <7 and the wave spawns the wave 1 creeps) The boss on the other hand changes with each average level
