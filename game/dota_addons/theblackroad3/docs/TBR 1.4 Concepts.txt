Classes
Harpy Magi
Primary - Downdraft
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates a relentless current of air on a target. When cast on an enemy, small high pressure gusts, that carry negative energies and debris, will cut and tear at them dealing damage and slowing them slightly for 20 seconds. When self-cast, the Harpy Magi will receive a boost to health and mana recovery for 10 seconds. When cast on an ally, the caster and the target will receive half of the total health and mana recovery for 10 seconds. When Downdraft is self-cast, the strength of the ability may slow the caster depending on the percentage of maximum health missing.
Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing
Cooldown: 10 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average

Notes:
• A decent single target DPS ability with a small slow effect. One of the few abilities that can regenerate mana, but should be used carefully; when self-cast the potency of the ability can slow the movement of the Harpy Magi if she's weakened.
• The health and mana regeneration is affected by Spell Healing in a similar way Valor is.

Secondary - Wind Shear
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates a rush of supersonic air downward on an enemy dealing damage and slowing the enemy's movement for 5 seconds. If Downdraft is active on the enemy when Wind Shear is cast, then they suffer increased damage and slowed attack speed as well.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 15 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average

Notes:
• An effective single target damage ability with a slow effect

Tertiary - Thunderclap
Effect: You call a bolt of lightning at a targeted location dealing damage in a 450 radius with heavier damage to units closer to the point of impact. Enemies within 200 units of the impact will be immobilized (if possible without stuns), and will be electrically charged. Electrically charged enemies suffer shock damage, and will create chain lightning feedback against themselves if they attack a hero in melee, for 5 seconds. Enemies between 201 and 450 units will only suffer the shock damage.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average

Notes:
• An AoE-focused damaging ability that has defensive utility immobilizing (or slowing otherwise) enemies.

Journeyman 1 - Voltaic Cyclone
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates an electrical storm focused on a targeted point. Seven voltaic orbs are created 600 units from the targeted point and, over several seconds, whirlpool centripetally towards it. Enemies struck by the orbs will take damage, while allies struck by the orbs will receive healing. When the orbs reach the center, they'll crash together dealing a large amount of damage at the point of impact. Enemies suffering from shock damage will take increased damage from the orbs.
Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing
Cooldown: 25 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: Average-High

Notes:
• A decent AoE damage/heal ability, with high single target damage. As the spell does not target a specific enemy it can miss easily if not used carefully.
• While not as easy to use a directed heals, the ability for a player to be struck many times during the spell (runs towards the center as the orbs travel) can make it extremely effective.

Journeyman 2 - Storm Shield (Channeled)
Effect: The Harpy Magi channels lightning towards all nearby allies creating a blanket of electricity around them. While the spell is channeling (and for an equal amount of time after the channeling has ended) heroes within range will receive reduced physical and magical damage, as well as increased attack damage and spell power. Can be channeled for up to 10 seconds. (Channeling cannot be broken by enemy stuns.)
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 800
Cost: High

Notes:
• If the Harpy Magi channels the ability for 5 seconds and then has to cancel it to move, players receive the buff for the duration of the channeling and then 5 seconds afterwards. This means that it can be channeled a maximum of 10 seconds, and last another 10 seconds for a total of 20 seconds.

Ultimate 1 - Inclemency
Effect: The Harpy Magi creates a swirling vortex that deals constant damage to all enemies nearby. The storm follows the caster for 30 seconds damaging enemies every second, and slowing their movement speed based on their missing health. Enemies with Downdraft take significantly more damage and slow. Allies with Downdraft receive more health regeneration and receive no movement reduction.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 500
Cost: High

Notes:
• A very effective AoE that can still be useful on single targets, and can provide some healing bonus, using Downdraft

Ultimate 2 - Ascension
Effect: The Harpy Magi lifts off of the ground and dives in a targeted direction damaging enemies in her path. While in the air the Harpy Magi is considered a flying unit, and is therefore immune to attacks and abilities that cannot target flying units. When the Harpy Magi reaches her destination she will hover in the air as a flying unit for 5 seconds before landing allowing the use of movement, attacking, and abilities as well as receiving increased Spell Power while in the air.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: High

Notes:
• A decent damage charge attack with the invaluable movement utility and a nice bonus to spell power

Class Skill - Gift Of The Elements
Effect: The Harpy Magi also receives 2 Spell Power per Strength, and 1 Spell Power per Agility.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• While Harpy Magi's still lose out on the Mana, Mana Regeneration and Attack Damage from Int, they can get a little more of the other stats without as much detriment to their abilities.

Class Notes:
• Designed to be an experimental, somewhat difficult to master, Caster DPS/Healer hybrid
• With proper use of abilities and tactics, the Harpy Magi can balance DPS and Healing very effectively

Champion of the Arena (Rough Draft)
Primary – Crushing Grip
Effect: The Champion and his target are immobilized. The Champion will continue to attack normally, but will also deal damage for the duration equal to: (Hero Damage + 2*Str) / (Current Attack Speed) per second. If either is moved by any effect, then the ability ends. Cast again to manually cancel the effect. The spell lasts a maximum of 10 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: Melee 
Cost: Average

Notes:
• A single target attack that immobilizes an enemy and scales well with both Str and Agi, as it takes Attack Speed, Hero Damage and Strength into account.

Secondary – Reckless Advance
Effects: The Champion rushes through enemies in a furious headlong charge. He will deal Agility-based damage to every enemy he hits, as well as taking 5% of maximum health damage himself per target. Twice the amount of health lost is added to the damage of the ability.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 25 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• Because the damage scales with both Agility AND maximum health, it can benefit from both Str and Agi builds.
• Can be used to escape melee or quickly enter it

Tertiary – Inspiration in War
Effects: If the Champion engages in combat for long enough, he will release a battle cry inspiring allies. Every second that the Champion either deals or receives damage, he gains a charge. After 20 charges have been gained, the Champion will automatically release his battle cry buffing the stats of nearby allies by 5% for 20 seconds. Charges will decay one per second if the Champion is out of combat for 10 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: 650 
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• While not an overly powerful skill it’s casted automatically without cost, buffs stats by % so it scales with any build, and applies to all allies in range making it increasingly useful in larger groups

Journeyman 1 – Herculean Roar (Channeled)
Effects: The Champion summons all the force inside himself and releases a long roar. Enemies within range suffer from reduced attack damage and increased damage taken while the ability is channelled, as well as for an equal amount of time after the channelling has ended. Allies in range are cleared of debuffs when the ability is cast. Can only be channelled for 10 seconds. (Channeling cannot be broken by enemy stuns.)
Benefits From: N/A

If an enemy is targeted, or is within 100 units of a targeted ally, the Champion will land on the enemy dealing high damage and immobilizing them for 5 seconds. Targeted allies will also receive a 2 second damage absorbing shield. 
Benefits From: N/A

Range: 600 
Cost: Average

Notes:
• The Champion is able to move quickly to a targeted point and assist an ally in distress

Ultimate 1 – Gladiator’s Salvation

Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: Melee
Cost: Average-High

Notes:
• A powerful single target DPS ability that gives the Champion magic damage.

Ultimate 2 - Invictus
Effect: The Champion gains a passive, static, reduction to damage taken and can additionally activate the ability to ignore the next incoming source of damage (magic or physical).
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• A powerful passive that can also be activated to avoid incoming spike damage. An asset for both tanks and DPS.

Class Skill - Adrenaline
Effects: The Champion has become so accustomed to life and death situations that his body consistently administers adrenaline, and boosts the quantity even more as he suffers. Adrenaline gives the Champion of the Arena increased movement, increasing x2 critical chance, and increased [BASE] health regeneration.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• The exact functioning is as such: Rank 1 gives 3 movement, 3% critical chance and 3% bonus to BASE health regeneration at all times. Every 10% health missing adds a multiplier, so it would be:
(Health) 100-91% = Bonus (3)%, 90-81% = (3x2)%, 80-71% = (3x3)%, 70-61% = (3x4)%, 60-51% = (3x5)%, 50-41% = (3x6)%, 40-31% = (3x7)%, 30-21% = (3x8)%, 20-11% = (3x9)%, 10-0% = (3x10)%
• Adrenaline gets 1% BASE added every 4 ranks, so at Rank 8 it has a minimum of +5/5% bonus, and a maximum of +50/50% bonus. Keep in mind it’s a 50% bonus to the BASE Strength Health Regeneration. This means:
Given a hypothetical value of 0.1 regeneration per point of Strength, 3498 Str would give ~350 regen a second. If the Champion was at 9% health, he would regen ~525 a second. (IE. 175 free regen)

Ranger
Primary - Puncture
Effect: You hit a vital point in the enemies defenses causing them to take static plus Agility damage over time. Agility increases the periodic damage of the effect while decreasing it's length, and Intelligence will increase the length of the effect while decreasing the periodic damage. Targets are slowed while affected by Puncture.
Benefits From: Spell Damage

Effect: You enchant your arrow to deal additional Intelligence-Based damage to the target. The target is debuffed for 1 second, applied before any damage. If the target dies while the debuff is active they explode damaging surrounding enemies for half the base damage of the skill.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 3 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• AoE damage has been nerfed slighty, as only taking half of the base instead of the full base amount. Final numbers will depend on balancing

Journeyman 2 - Poisoned Arrow (Autocastable)
Effect: You coat your arrow in a concentrated poison and fire it deep into the enemy.

Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing

Cost: High

Notes:
• Can be made into a very effective single target damage spell, or a very effective AoE heal. It can also be decent at both with balance
• The range of the AoE heal is cut in half to around 300. It's either that or nerf the healing drastically, and I'd prefer them to be effective tank healers

Benefits From: N/A

Cost: N/A

Notes:
• A nice passive bonus to damage as well as the ability to steal mana every attack

Class Notes:

Cost: N/A

Notes:
• Players revived by Hallowed Ground will have no mana and health equal to: 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%
• As the dead player MUST be in Hallowed Ground for the entire duration, a Templar cannot cast Hallowed Ground then Benediction killing himself and revive himself

Class Notes:

• While the Templars abilities can be used to extreme effect, they can also function extremely poorly if not used with discretion

Class Notes:
• Designed to be effective tanks, and effective DPS with the option of being a hybrid in between and acting as an offtank

BOSSES


Name: The Arachtriarch
Location: North East in Spider Forest
Level: 200
Abilities: Stun Immune, Multishot Poison Attack, Spawns Minions, Massive Stacking AoE Poison Spell, Shriek of the Deep, Single Target Disable. Two Phase Fight.

Phase One: Her attack has a (3) second cooldown, and does static (1000) poison damage a second for 5 seconds. She will often cast "Silk Rush" on her current target, where she charges into melee with them stunning them, dealing damage based on how many stacks of poison they have, wrapping them in a cacoon, and moving on to a new target. While the target is in a cacoon they are untargetable by spells or attacks, stunned and take static damage every second. The effect lasts until the cacoon is destroyed or the player dies. If a player dies to cacoon a small group of spiders will spawn from their corpse. She will occasionally cast "Poison Dispersion" over a very large area that has a long duration, deals 2% max health in damage, and can stack. Both poison effects remain on characters in cacoons. She will also occasionally cast "Shriek of the Deep" slowing the movement speed and attack speed of all players in her area as well as preventing casting for the duration. She will frequently spawn small spiders, stronger than the normal ones in the area, but relatively weak in comparison to her. These spiders will drop items for curing poison effects.

Phase Two: Phase two will begin when Arachtriarch reaches 15% health. She will stop using her main attack and will be immobile, and focus on casting her AoE cloud many times as often, and spawning spiders faster.

Notes:
• If you defeat Arachtriarch without anyone getting 3 stacks of Inhaled Poison or more, there will be increased drops.
• A tank is not entirely necessary for this fight, but it could make it easier to keep her attention in a specific direction. Controlling her main attacks poison will help a lot in reducing damage people are taking as it will multishot unlimited players in front of her. Keep her facing away.
• Her "Poison Dispersion" is her most dangerous ability. One stack will only deal 2% of max health in damage, but several stacks can make this very dangerous. Especially if it's on multiple people at once. Use Antivenom appropriately and work as a group.
• When phase two starts it is a DPS race. You will need to kill her before the group gets too many stacks of (Inhaled Poison) as she will be spamming the ability constantly. Spiders will spawn at an increased rate, but not quite as fast as her poison is cast... so focus on killing her and not on trying to outlast/cure the poison.

Name: Leviathan
Location: Locris Coast
Level: 200
Abilities: Stun Immune, Massive Regeneration, Alternating Resistances, Ricochet Attack, Gains a buff if an Elemental dies nearby, AoE Spell that disables spells for a short period, Aura that prevents reviving and causes powerful minions to spawn from player corpses, Skyward Mortar

Phase One: Leviathan has 75% evasion.

Phase Two: Leviathan has 75% spell reduction.

Both Phases: Leviathan is immobile for the entire fight and spawns directly between the south west island and the coast of Locris, touching both shores due to his size. His main attack has an unlimited Ricochet (though it can only hit a player once per attack), so players will have to space out from eachother. If an elemental dies within a 600 unit range of him he will get a 100% damage buff for a very short duration. He will have an ability resembling "Healspray" that he will cast primarily on high mana heros. It will disable casting for a short duration and deal static damage. He will occasionally cast a spell called "Skyward Mortar". He will launch a projectile into the air that will target land around him randomly. A marker will appear on the ground signalling where it will land, and players will have a short window of time to move out of the way. It will do a static, and unreducible, 25,000 damage. Should a hero die near Leviathan, any secondary forms of revive are disabled, and a Spawn of Leviathan will be created at their corpse that has a high attack damage.

Notes:
• If you can accomplish the fight without a single person dying, or the boss being buffed from an elemental dying, there will be increased drops.

Name: Grand Vanquisher of the Underworld
Location: Undead Area @ Crypt
Level: 200
Abilities: Stun Immune. Has mana in the countless millions and Mana Shield. Many different abilities and effects depending on what phase. Three phase fight.

Phase One: When you attack the boss it starts the phase one timer. For this phase he is immobile and has no standard attack. The boss will use 10% of his max mana to summon a very powerful undead randomly in the area. He will summon another add every 25 seconds UNLESS you kill the minion. If his summon dies before the 25 seconds he will immediately summon a minion and start a new 25 second spell timer. The boss will enter Phase two after 180 seconds regaining all of his mana. To force him into phase three you must kill his adds fast enough to make him summon 10 before the 180 second time limit. He will occasionally cast "Despair" to all players in the area stunning them for a short period and dealing DoT damage for a long duration. A secondary effect to "Despair" is it also deals instant damage determined by 150*(% of each characters max health missing). He will "Empower" his summoned minion occasionally increasing it's attack speed and damage significantly for a very brief period. He will often cast "Grasp of the Underworld" which will root one player and deal DoT damage while they are rooted. His main form of attack is "Disintegrate" where he will "Locks on to X" and cast a beam of light that follows them for a short time dealing massive damage to anyone it moves over.

Phase Two: The boss has re-established his connection to the spirits of the underworld and siphons their energy at an extraordinary rate. The boss recovers 5% of maximum mana per second. If you do incredible damage to him, you can cancel the effect, however it will be very difficult. When the boss reaches 100% mana or his channeling is cancelled, Phase One restarts.

Phase Three: Phase three only happens if you get the boss to 0 mana. In phase three he gains a melee attack and movement, as well as new abilities. He will have zero mana, so he cannot use summons, "Empower" or "Disintegrate". He will still use "Despair" and "Grasp of the Underworld". He will start using "Imminent Defeat" on his current target occasionally, dealing large static damage, knocking them back, removing all buffs and slowing movement and attack speed to minimum for 3 seconds. He'll also use "Kinetic Command" often, placing a damage absorbing shield on him, and at the end of the short duration dealing absorbed damage (based off Divine reduction) back to all players in the area. He is unable to perform any actions while channeling "Kinetic Command".

Notes: 
• The boss is undead, and will summon undead, so all of them will benefit from the Necromancers global aura. While not killing the Necromancer will make the fight harder, the drops will be increased for being able to accomplish this. It is not however recommended people attempt this until they are comfortable killing the boss without any complications.
• The Grand Vanquisher's summons will give large amounts of gold, mats and experience. Farming the minions endlessly can yield incredible returns. Fighting him before level 200 is not recommended however, so gold and mats will be the primary advantage for most people. For those extremely talented groups, farming minions constantly can provide you with levels, gold, and mats faster than any other way.
• It will be strongly recommended two healers are brought to this fight. One for spam healing the tank, and one for HoT'ing the entire group. Players must be kept at relatively high max health or Despair will start doing massive burst damage.





While Pudel is finishing up 1.36c I want to discuss, as a community, some concepts for 1.4. The map is going to go through a lot of changes, but I want to get feedback on certain dramatic propositions in an attempt to ensure it's in the best interest of the map.

Before I discuss any ideas in detail, I'd like to list a few points that have influenced my position:
(1) Melee DPS in 1.3 are less desirable than ranged for several reasons: The only difficult boss has thorns, melee die often to bosses changing target, they have to spend time running back and forth to change targets, and too many melee crowd combat and can hinder mobility.

(2) Players have infinite mana in 1.3 because of Hera's Blessing. This could be rebalanced, though I don't believe it would make more people play (and enjoy) the map.

(3) Even if items in the game were increased to allow different builds, there are barely enough bank slots to accomodate 2 (let alone any other items, like crafting components).

(4) If only one person is in the game, the game ends. This doesn't "encourage" group play, but instead "forces" it. (This tactic doesn't work for players with access to more than one computer, or any other system that bypasses the game detecting 1 player in the game)

(5) Players AFK because materials required for crafting are absurdly high and max level requires a lot of grinding.

Some of my ideas for each of these points are as follows:
(1) Reduce the gap between Melee DPS EHP and Tank EHP. Currently in 1.3 a tank will have roughly 75,000 hp and 90% armor - this gives them an EHP around 750,000 (not including evasion, block, etc). Melee DPS have around: 50,000 health and 75% armor, or 25,000 health and 85% armor. These equal 200,000 and 166,667 EHP respectively. This is obviously an attempt to make them "off-tanky" enough to survive, but it didn't work. Not even including the other bonuses, tanks are almost 4x the EHP of melee. Is it necessary to have this gap? While it does make tanks seem more "beefy", and required, a few levels usually allow DPS to solo bosses. The only situations that this doesn't apply to are Hades and Hyperion, which is because they are too close to the level cap to outlevel. Since players will be able to outlevel content no matter what system is used, balance at maximum level should be the priority. I believe that closing the gap between Melee DPS EHP and Tank EHP will help prevent Melee DPS from dying as often, while also creating more dynamic fights.

There are numerous ways of accomplishing this, so I won't get into specifics about stats, but I will describe how it would play out in game.
SPOILER(Low Difference in EHP Boss Fight): HIDE
A full group of mixed characters enter a level 200 boss area. The Tank has 80k EHP, while the Melee DPS have 60K EHP, and the Ranged DPS/Healers have 40K EHP. The healers are just barely able to keep the tank at full health under normal conditions, and suffer a little when dealing with AoE and events. If the Tank dies, the melee are close enough in EHP that they can survive roughly 2/3 as long giving the healers time to ressurect the Tank. It's important to get the tank back up because of the increased ease of healing them (so it's more necessary long term, than short term). If there are no Melee, the boss could easily run around stomping ranged characters. This makes melee valuable as offtanks (that actually survive a few hits), while the unique class skills and varied boss events make mixed groups preferable to a group full of one build. Long boss fights make tanks crucial.


(2) Rebalancing the map so that players constantly run out of mana I think would only annoy players. With that said, I don't like players spamming all skills every cooldown without a single thought. My ideal system has players thinking more about what to do in that specific circumstance, instead of trying to plan out their character in town to work in any circumstance (like currently). The best solution I've come up with to accomplish this is actually from a game I don't generally talk well about - Diablo 3. By making energy come back very rapidly, but having spells rebalanced to have high costs and no cooldowns, players are now more interested in managing how damage efficient their spells are in the current circumstance versus the energy efficiency. Some spells likely would still have cooldowns due to the nature of the spell, but largely speaking you could spam anything. By varying buffs and debuffs on skills, it helps alleviate specific rotations. The primary advantage of this system is no more running out of mana and having to return to town to sit around for 60 seconds, or dying in a boss fight because your healer "doesn't have enough regen yet". Boss fights would be balanced around effective healing per second instead of around effective mana conservation. Instead of limiting the spamming of spells with cooldowns, it's limited with set regeneration values and max resource. I think this eliminates a lot of unnecessary hastle related to healing and allows those healers to instead think of their spells, and not their mana.

(3) RPG's are all about items, in one way or another. Having cool skills in nice, but having cool skills AND cool armor is much better. Looking like a badass is sometimes more important to people than actually being a badass - having both is perfect. The main problem in 1.3 is the lack of viable gear choices. With a new save system, there is almost unlimited room for improvement. A top priority of mine is to create more items than anyone would know what to do with, and the room to save most of them. Banks will need to be redesigned somehow to accomodate much larger quantities of items, so players can collect multiple sets of gear for varying encounters.

Related to items is developing a new system for dropping items. The current "random item dropped on the ground, and hoping no one steals it" is a poorly designed system. Pudel has recommend a rolling system for items. I don't like a "forced" rolling system much more than the current FFA system, because it doesn't fix the system - only improves it. Griefers can obviously still roll on items they don't need and steal them (though much less likely). This is something that should be looked into to try and remove any possiblity of stealing, while still allowing trading and even distribution of loot.

(4) The concept of ending the game when only one player is left is for a few reasons: To prevent players from AFKing for long periods in bot games wasting a host slot, to prevent players from AFKing in mob-zones to level, and probably initially to help prevent playing in single player. This system does not work. While it does to a small degree help keep hostbots clear, many gamers have found ways around the 1 player limit - it really only punishes a portion of the community then and gives unfair advantage to those with ways around it. 1.4 should no longer have a 1 player auto-end feature, or require more than one player to start. Obviously "Single Player" will automatically end/crash to prevent cheats, and bots will have autohost requirements, but anyone will be able to host a solo game on Lan if they don't have internet or friends.

New systems will be implemented to "encourage" group play of course. Waves will scale differently to: better represent the strength of the players, and scale in a way that fighting a wave alone is "proportionately" harder than fighting a wave with 7-11 other players. Areas in the game will also feature entirely new enemy designs, where some enemies are strong against physical and others magical. This will provide a moderate benefit to players who adventure with a hero of the other type. Areas will also spawn elites. The trigger for the elites would be an increasing percent spawn chance per minute based on the number of players in that area (not in the game), so being in an area alone will have them spawn less often. Elites will be tuned far above that area's average strength however, and will be difficult - to impossible - for a solo player near its level. While they are easily ran from (and they reset with the area), they do provide unique items and large rewards making them certainly worth killing.

More systems are also considered (like increased experience and material gains for more players in the game) to encourage group play while also not entirely requiring it. Related to this issue is endgame boss scaling. Making endgame bosses require the maximum number of players will likely cause the map to die extremely fast, though making the bosses too easy will also cause it to lose interest quickly. I proposed bosses scaling with the number of players in the game in such a way that it would require at least 5 players to have a chance, and get proportionately harder for each player added to the game. The balance of difficulty would error on the side of the players so that it's definitely more beneficial to have a group, but that it's not easy even with a full group. Pudel suggested increasing the player limit, so that's something to consider. It's rare these days to have 8 people in a game, but when you do it can certainly get crowded. Having 12 players in a game might cause pathing issues. At the same time, having more players allows for boss fights to become far more dynamic. A group could be expected to consist of 3 Tanks, 3 Healers and 6 DPS. One Main Tank, one tank for absorbing attacks that only hit the player with the highest "max" health, and a third for add control. Healers in 1.4 are quite different from one another so allowing three per battle helps balance (and utilize) their unique talents, instead of having to pick 1 or two max. If 12 players is possible, it definitely sounds interesting.

(5) This has been talked about for a long time and solutions for most of the problems have been found. I don't have the notes in front of me, but duping has been basically eliminated in 1.4, meaning that costs of things can be brought back down to reasonable ranges. There is no need to have things cost hundreds of thousands of materials, and by preventing duping and AFKing if you did make it required, no one would bother to do it. We also do not want to make items untradeable, so we have to use a system of item "replacement and binding" creatively. Items bought from a shop spawn a bound item that can be resold. It's possible to unbind the item, but it is replaced by one that cannot be sold. At least I think that was the system - I'll have to check when I get my old harddrive back. (The item, when a player tries to sell the unbound version, should display a message, "The Warranty is void on tampered with products.")

(6) To make areas and fights a little more dynamic (than 1.3) I'd like to make two distinct categories of enemies - physical resistant and magical resistant. There will be at least one of each in every area, and possibly an unmodified one in areas with odd numbers of mobs. While noticable, they will of course be balanced not to make soloing impossible (or even super difficult). A hypothetical example would be ~40% evasion/armor/block for physical resistant, and ~40% resist for magical (numbers, again, are hypothetical and not final values). This supports group work, while not forcing it.

A system I would like to use (but haven't discussed with Pudel how realistic it is yet... not until 1.36c is finished), is to have pools of skills that mobs can be spawned with randomly. Mobs would have specific numbers of skill slots, and they would fill those slots randomly from a list of possible skills. This will sound like Elites from Diablo III, though I should mention that I had the system in mind before Diablo III came out (Way back, when I first started redesigning bosses, I designed the new Hyperion to have 4 categories of randomly selected skills. This is just carrying the idea to every single mob in the game). Most skills would simply scale to mob stats, so balancing them between Minions, Elites, and Bosses should be rather easy. Not all skills would be random however, otherwise all mobs would simply feel the same. Every single mob in the game has at minimum 1 static skill that truly defines them (stronger mobs may have multiple static skills). Skill pools would likely exist for specific bosses as well, like the new endgame ones. (NOTE: These don't refer to "Events". Most bosses will have triggered Events that are entirely independant of skill pools)

So in summary, skills on enemies will vary from one to the next so you don't know exactly what an enemy will do. This also promotes teamwork as a physical resist enemy may spawn with increased regeneration - which may become very time consuming. TBR has never been about having to pay attention every millisecond (or you might die - like 2.0), so I'd keep that tradition for leveling. Mobs would be too dangerous to AFK, but not ridiculous to the point of gibbing you if you use the wrong skill to start the fight. I naturally want the game to feel like the same game, and mob balancing is important to accomplish that.

(7) Reterraining. While initially this was reserved to touch-ups, I'm considering something more dramatic.

The layout of The Black Road 1.3 is very distinctive, and I obviously don't want to change it much, but I would like to add on. Enlarging the borders of the map increases the file size dramatically, so instead I've thought of a better option. I'd like to reduce the size of models in the map by at least 50% (and slowing movement speed proportionately) to make the map feel bigger. To utilize this change (and not make the map feel like an annoying runfest) I'd also, essentially, reterrain the entire map into a smaller version of itself. This would make the map feel almost identical to 1.3, but free up tons of border room for new areas or other systems (PvP arenas, PvE arenas, Integrated Crafting, Dungeons, Integrated Banks). I believe this is the only way to keep the file size reasonable while adding a lot of new content. Again, I'd be shrinking the map to a smaller version of itself while keeping the layout almost identical.

(8) Integrated Crafting and Banking? These are just rough concepts at the moment, but the idea would be to remove those pop-up menus from the game as well as the 6 item storage limitation.

Crafting could be activated from the character (Patrol removed and a small spellbook added for quick commands. Players could then open the spellbook by hotkey and change the camera, craft items, or display information by pressing another hotkey. This allows for most commands to be done by two quick button presses). Instead of listing recipes in windows, they could be listed in buildings. Give items a short crafting time, and then they appear in your wisp (or under you). The short duration is to prevent duping items by glitching the item cue, so it wouldn't need to be more than 1 second. This allows for windowless crafting that technically wouldn't even need a crafting button; players could just hotkey their crafting buildings. It would be much faster and never cause players to miss chat, or crash.

For Banks, there are dozens of effective solutions. An area for each player could be allocated in one corner of the map. Items could be stored in that area in many different ways, but regardless of the method it would allow for many to be stored. Banks in town could still exist, but instead have pages that link to the other buildings you have. Here's what first popped into my head:
SPOILER(Bank System): HIDE
(1) Player buys a Bank and it shows up the same way as 1.3.
(2) When an item is dropped in the new Bank, however, it automaticaly assigns it to the first available slot in the "bank" zone, and it disappears from the deposit box.
• The "Bank" zone would be an area where player banks are stored. They would be player separated, but they "would" be designed to accomodate easy moving of items between "tabs".
(3) The Bank in town has "skills" you click on to access different bank "tabs", which are just copies of the bank it links to.

So this is simply creating multiple banks with the Bank in town being a way to quick swap between them, as well as quickly deposit into them. There are countless other ways of doing this, so I should just point out what I feel is important: Storing many more items without having to do more work (like teleporting back and forth, etc), as well as accessing ALL of those items equally as easily.

With these concepts every single "window" should be gone from the game, systems for crafting and items should be just as fast (if not faster), and they should accomodate dramatically more items than previous versions.

I'd like to emphasize that 1.4 will not have a steep learning curve. 1.3 did not, and thus 1.4 will not. Even though many new systems are being used, and many changes are being made, it's my job to make sure the game will still play like previous versions. Endgame content will obviously be more complicated than 1.3, but it will build up to that over 200 levels. Leveling a character in 1.4 will be intuitive - you will do what feels normal and learn systems systematically. The starting areas will explain stats while you experiment with the new skills. After that, you'll be introduced to enemy types, and enemy abilities. Elites will introduce themselves after basic concepts are solid. Everything will be done with proper pacing so it doesn't feel like a chore.

I've been withholding bringing up stats because they have so many possible variations. I'll list one possibility, though keep in mind that this thread is about ideas, and not what I'm saying has to be in the map (this is a discussion thread).

(9) Slightly changed stats. As both Strength and Agility are predominantly physical heroes, a system needs to exist that makes them equally capable with physical attacks. 1.3 is somewhat balanced in this regard as Strength heroes need Agility, and Agility heroes need Strength (some balancing could improve it, but the point is that it's somewhat close). While it's possible to use the same system, and only make subtle changes to improve balance, I'd like there to be a noticable offensive difference between the two. I'd also like there to be a noticable difference between Strength and Agility defensively. This would create a difference between Strength Tanks, Agility Tanks, Strength DPS, Agility DPS, Caster DPS, and Caster Healers (or create 6 different roles heroes can fill).

As mentioned previously, items would be what truly define your role. Without items, Strength and Agility heroes would be equal in offensive and defensive capabilities. When items are worn, however, it boosts your damage or defense significantly. Not only does this allow for certain enemies to have a bias against more builds (Hypothetically, Agility attack faster whereas Strength hit slower but harder. Some enemies might transform if they are hit too many times, making Strength DPS better to use. Some enemies might have a damage "cap", where any damage above that amount is ignored, making the faster smaller damages more effective) which makes a little more dynamic combat, but it also allows for more items and builds.

I think it would make heroes feel more useful being able to build in so many different ways. DPS wouldn't encompass every single damage character and build - Strength DPS, Agility DPS, and Caster DPS would function differently enough to warrant paying attention to, but similar enough that it isn't forced to have one of each every game. Pudel and I are talking specifics at the moment, but that's the general concept.

Simply put, I want there to be a lot of content for people to experience. By making two different melee types (as well as two tank, and two casters), players could be even further encouraged (skills aside) to level new characters. Those new roles could utilize certain items differently. This allows for more dynamic enemies as well as items ==> You can build as a hybrid melee (balance attack speed and critical) and have marginal difficulty against most mobs, or specialize so you can dominate certain mobs (and have someone play the reverse to balance your designed weakness).

So yeah, items will be vastly different. Pudel and I don't like generic items (like +25 all stats, or +100 Strength). Stats should be stats, and items should be items. There may be "item stats" that are appealing to multiple roles, like +damage, but there likely won't be much for generic stats on items. I picture endgame items looking more like:

Champion's Banhammer of Hipster Wrath
5% chance to cast rank 8 Hammer of the Gods on attack.
5% chance to stun minions for 15 seconds.
Increases attack damage by 500
Increases Critical Chance by 100
Increases Critical Damage by 100
Nearby deaths increase the wielders damage by 50 for 5 seconds.

The stun would only work on non-boss mobs (though any damage would proc it - spell or melee). The Critical values are static numbers that stack, so every item and skill that gives "static" amounts will scale together. This is obviously a DPS weapon aimed at burst damage (no attack speed, just damage and critical - with a low chance of a powerful skill), though several builds could technically use it. That's the goal essentially - if you're a Strength hero, you don't look for Strength items... you look for items with whatever stats you want at that time. Sometimes it might be attack speed, sometimes more crit, and sometimes you will want to mix tank and DPS items. As far as items specifically for your "stat" type, I really don't want to see any.
