Take with a grain of salt.

1. 200 levels is too much
	1. stat oversaturation
	2. quickly hit attckspeed cap
	3. many levels are just filler
	4. milestones are too far away
	5. little accomplishment apart from some stats

2. Eigth rank skills
	1. Dont fit in the HUD
	2. Tooltips cant show all the damage scaling numbers
	3. Odd level upgrades, with a lower level cap it could be normalized (5-10-20-etc)
	4. Arbitrary restrictions on book drops/purchases
	5. Buying new skills with books is lame and tedious, unlock/reward is better
	
3. Orb Skills are awkward/cheap way to make abilities scale
4. Disabling bosses or even worse permastunning them with disable rotation is undesirable
5. Divine armor is just a way of saying 'we cant balance damage growing so fast so we are just going to substract 90% of it'
6. Archetypes: "Warrior Classes" are a mess and could be way better using classic Warrior/Rogue/Pala system. 
	KC and SW are the Tank Warrior class; Barbarian and Warlord are the DPS Warriors, TG and GoN are Hybrid Warrior aka Paladin. Assassin is a Rogue
7. Manaburning a boss until it cant cast spells is awful, spell cast of enemies should be CD based
8. Everyone is a damage dealer with some classes having 1 or 2 healing spells that can be instant cast and then continue DPS.
9. The concept of Tank is not fully defined, specially seeing how aggro works. 
	Having some skillset options 2 or 3 "Tank Classes" that formalizes their role and makes having a Tank a must for a party to success would be way better.
10. Variable party size allows for more games and diversity in the current workshop status, but after a while the boss encounter balance can get really messy when dealing with solo, 2, 5, etc
