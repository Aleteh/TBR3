//Class Skill - Nature's Defence
//Effect: You have a 15% chance when you cast a spell and an additional 5% chance when struck by an enemy of summoning an AI controlled Treant. Treants will heal a target once every second they're alive, //targetting allied heros in a 700 range missing the highest percent of maximum health. Their heal is dependant on the Guardian of Nature's Spell Healing, and their health is dependant on the Guardian of Natures //health. When the Treants die or expire, the Guardian of Nature that summoned them is healed based on the Treants health. Treants last 5 seconds.
//Benefits From: N/A
//Cooldown: N/A
//Range: N/A
//Cost: N/A

//Notes:
//• Treants for Int GoN's heal allies more, while healing the GoN less when they expire. Treants for Str GoN's heal allies less, while healing the GoN more when they expire.
