//Ultimate 1 - Foreboding Mark
//Effect: Places a percent damage buff on the targetted friendly unit of this spell, as well as the caster, for a short time. Any attacks made by the caster during this time will place a short taunt debuff on the enemy, forcing it to attack the targetted unit of the spell. Lasts 5 seconds. If this ability is used on a Shadow Image it loses the increased damage taken for the duration as well as taking 50% less damage.
//Benefits From: N/A
//Cooldown: 30 seconds
//Range: 300
//Cost: High

//Notes:
//• Mixture of offensive and defensive, the damage buff is exceptionally nice offensively
//• Can be used to help keep threat on a tank if they are stunned, knocked back, or there's an extra add running around.
