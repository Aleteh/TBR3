//Ultimate 1 - Haunt
//Effect: You instill fear and paranoia into an enemy, causing them to see phantoms while also dealing damage to them over time. The target will suffer damage every 4 seconds, and everytime they do a Spectre will spawn beside them. The Spectre has no attack, dies after 1 damage and only lasts 3 seconds, but it returns an enormous percentage of received damage back to the attacker. Haunt lasts 16 seconds. Enemies feel very threatened by Spectres.
//Benefits From: Spell Damage
//Cooldown: 32 seconds
//Range: 600
//Cost: High

//Notes:
//• An effective way to help mitigate group damage causing the enemy to potentially waste attacks on the Spectres.
//• Can be very effective is used in conjunction with Requiem
