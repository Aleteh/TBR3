//Ultimate 2 - Testudo
//Effect: You order nearby allies to create a defensive formation around your current position. Allies will use anything available to create a wall between them and enemies. Incoming ranged attacks are reduced by 30% and Spell Resist is increased, to those in the formation. Lasts 40 seconds.
//Benefits From: N/A
//Cooldown: 40 seconds
//Range: 450
//Cost: High

//Notes:
//• A very effective defensive ability reducing incoming damages to allies. Requires bunching up however which can be more detrimental than beneficial and thus requires considerations. Functions differently than //Phalanx in the form of increasing Spell Resist instead of using percent reduction - this can lead to varying gains. Additionally, because it uses Spell Resist values it also decreases debuff lengths which //Phalanx does not.
