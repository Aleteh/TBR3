Aknowledgements:

	1. TBR Greek lore doesn't fit Dota and is unnecessary, trying to reutilize some Dota world lore to make new anthagonists would be way better and a perfect move to attract dota players, make an involving game and get good promotional material.
	2. Making a new game instead of being locked into a port, taking just the good concepts of TBR and expand with the available assets and features, will provide a way better result.
	3. There are class names that arent self-defining nor real class archetypes: KC, SW, TG, GoN.
	4. A good RPG should have classes that define a playstyle, and be able to be played in 2 or 3 different ways: Tank/DPS/Heal, Caster/Melee, Summon/Nuke, etc.

	* Be able to swap specs easily
	* 3 Starting abilities+Class Skill?
