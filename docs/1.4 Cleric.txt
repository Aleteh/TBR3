Cooldown: 2 minutes
Range: N/A

• Clerics are now able to choose when and who they revive, but they must be within casting range to do so. It also provides them some personal benefit.

Class Notes:
• Clerics have a lot of heal and damage potential, but which one's more effective will depend largely on gear choices
• Though they are not the only class that can revive (anymore), they have the ability to revive a single target for average mana, or multiple targets for a large amount of mana. Their ability to do it quickly is their biggest advantage.
