Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: 700
Cost: Average

Notes:
• Another classic Spartan Warrior ability returning with only some rebalancing


Ultimate 2 - Testudo
Effect: You order nearby allies to create a defensive formation around your current position. Allies will use anything available to create a wall between them and enemies. Incoming ranged attacks are reduced by 30% and Spell Resist is increased, to those in the formation. Lasts 40 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 40 seconds
Range: 450
Cost: High

Notes:
• A very effective defensive ability reducing incoming damages to allies. Requires bunching up however which can be more detrimental than beneficial and thus requires considerations. Functions differently than Phalanx in the form of increasing Spell Resist instead of using percent reduction - this can lead to varying gains. Additionally, because it uses Spell Resist values it also decreases debuff lengths which Phalanx does not.


Class Skill - Last Stand
Effect: Once per minute when your hero is brought to near death his evasion and spell resist are increased to 90% for 5 seconds. Does not stack with any similar effects.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 60 seconds
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• Largely dependant on balancing, this ability will allow Spartan Warriors a brief grace period, where they refuse to go down without a fight, before death takes them


Class Notes:
• The Spartan Warrior class is given the option of being a Strength DPS or Intelligence DPS with strength doing mildly more damage, but intelligence providing mildly better buffs. They can also be effective group healers.
