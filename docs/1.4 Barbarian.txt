Notes:
• Barbarians skin is more resilient than most humans. It calluses when injured making them less susceptible to damage for a time.

Class Notes:
• Designed to be effective tanks, and effective DPS with the option of being a hybrid in between and acting as an offtank
• Barbarians are intended to be an unstoppable force of destruction. If they want to attack something, nothing will stop them. Thus Charge has a short cooldown, causes very high (temporary) movement and can push enemies aside to reach a target
