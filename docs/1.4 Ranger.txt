Ranger
Primary - Puncture
Effect: You hit a vital point in the enemies defenses causing them to take static plus Agility damage over time. Agility increases the periodic damage of the effect while decreasing it's length, and Intelligence will increase the length of the effect while decreasing the periodic damage. Targets are slowed while affected by Puncture.
Benefits From: Spell Damage

Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• The maximum length increase will not excede the cooldown
• The DoT increase and length increase will be balanced DPS wise

Secondary - Strafe

Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 18 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• The increased hits and increased damage per hit will be balanced DPS wise

Cost: N/A

Journeyman 1 - Black Arrow (Autocastable)
Effect: You enchant your arrow to deal additional Intelligence-Based damage to the target. The target is debuffed for 1 second, applied before any damage. If the target dies while the debuff is active they explode damaging surrounding enemies for half the base damage of the skill.
Benefits From: Spell Damage
Cooldown: 3 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• AoE damage has been nerfed slighty, as only taking half of the base instead of the full base amount. Final numbers will depend on balancing

Journeyman 2 - Poisoned Arrow (Autocastable)
Effect: You coat your arrow in a concentrated poison and fire it deep into the enemy. They initially take static plus Agility damage and then poison damage over time based on the level of the enemy. The poison reacts more violently the stronger the immune system, thus dealing increased damage to stronger enemies.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 16 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• Effective single target ability with a chance to debuff the enemy, as well as dealing poison damage based off the enemies level

Ultimate 1 - Star Dust
Effect: You call down a star from the heavens damaging a targetted enemy. The star deals physical damage based on Spell Damage, and the exuded particles heal allies in 300 range of the enemy every 2 seconds as well as the caster for an equal amount based on Spell Healing. Lasts 16 seconds.
Benefits From: Spell Damage, Spell Healing
Cooldown: 22 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: High

Notes:
• Can be made into a very effective single target damage spell, or a very effective AoE heal. It can also be decent at both with balance
• The range of the AoE heal is cut in half to around 300. It's either that or nerf the healing drastically, and I'd prefer them to be effective tank healers

Ultimate 2 - Aimed Shot
Effect: You study your enemy and fire an arrow with all possible accuracy and care. You deal static plus Agility damage and reduce the targets health regeneration by 40% for 12 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 25 seconds
Range: 650
Cost: High

Notes:
• Very high single target damage, and the rare ability to decrease the enemies ability to regenerate health. Very effective on multiple bosses

Class Skill - Soul-Piercing Shot
Effect: You have a 5% chance to deal X*(Agility+Intelligence) to your target. Additionally you steal X mana from your target every hit, if it has mana.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• A nice passive bonus to damage as well as the ability to steal mana every attack

Class Notes:
• Rangers are first and foremost a DPS class, with minor hybrid capabilities. They are not intended to be entire group healers. With some specialization however they can be quite effective DPS and quite effective tank/melee healers.
• Agility Rangers will deal higher damage than Intelligence Rangers but will not have the ability to assist in healing
