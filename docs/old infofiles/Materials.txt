Crafting Materials - Custom Resource

You can get 230000 Crafting materials
+X Crafting materials green popup, as with Gold/XP
Resource is saved. Items normally aren't.

Source 1. There are 3 places where monsters give additional materials when killed. These are autoassigned to everyone near them in equal quantities (not split).

Source 2. Every mob in the game also has a chance to drop a crafting item which you click on to aquire, these are generally all free-for-all, and by late game people dont even bother picking them up anymore. Each item dropped is profession specific, if you try and pick up a goldleaf for example and you are not an Alchemist then it will just come up with red text saying No.

Source 3. There last option to get materials fast is to buy them. It costs 150 gold for 10 and 1500 gold for 100. If you have a lot of excess gold then go ahead and buy it to level your profession, but remember to keep enough for skill books.
