"A horde of demons has been unleashed from the Underworld and is heading for Athens."

Rules to spawn the demon waves will be the following:

After everyone has picked and succesfully loaded their heroes
Time until city attack = 10 minutes + math.floor(Average Party Level/10) * 30 seconds.
	avg party level 1  = 10 minutes
	avg party level 20 = 11 minutes
	avg party level 100= 15 minutes
	avg party level 200= 20 minutes (max)
After an attack is launched, the next attack will start counting down only after all the units are killed.

The wave strength is based on the party level
