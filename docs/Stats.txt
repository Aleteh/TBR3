- New Stats

Reduce BAT ("Haste", reduces base attack time by a static value so Attack Speed becomes way better)
Crit Chance and Crit Bonus (Base should be x1.5 or x2)
Spell Crit (Chance of Multiply, with another stat for +Spell Crit Bonus)
Join Spell and Healing power into a single Spell Power stat (as it only penalizes healers and no one likes being the healer)


- About Item Slots

6 "main" slots are generally: Main Hand, Off Hand (Shield or Second Weapon), Head, Chest, Legs, Feet (aka Boots).

Other slots generally are:
Wrist (aka Bracers), Hands (aka Gloves), Waist (aka Belt), Back (aka Cape)

Option 1. (Currently) No restrictions on slots, a hero can have 2 weapons 2 shields and 2 boots. 6 default item slots
Option 2. Keep 6 default item slots but restrict to only 2 weapons, or 1 two-handed weapon, or 1 weapon+shield, same for Head/Chest/Legs etc.
Option 3. Make a custom inventory system with UI to hold 10~13 item slots
