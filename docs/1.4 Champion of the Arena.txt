Champion of the Arena (Rough Draft)
Primary – Crushing Grip
Effect: The Champion and his target are immobilized. The Champion will continue to attack normally, but will also deal damage for the duration equal to: (Hero Damage + 2*Str) / (Current Attack Speed) per second. If either is moved by any effect, then the ability ends. Cast again to manually cancel the effect. The spell lasts a maximum of 10 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: Melee 
Cost: Average

Notes:
• A single target attack that immobilizes an enemy and scales well with both Str and Agi, as it takes Attack Speed, Hero Damage and Strength into account.

Secondary – Reckless Advance
Effects: The Champion rushes through enemies in a furious headlong charge. He will deal Agility-based damage to every enemy he hits, as well as taking 5% of maximum health damage himself per target. Twice the amount of health lost is added to the damage of the ability.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 25 seconds
Range: 600
Cost: Average

Notes:
• Because the damage scales with both Agility AND maximum health, it can benefit from both Str and Agi builds.
• Can be used to escape melee or quickly enter it

Tertiary – Inspiration in War
Effects: If the Champion engages in combat for long enough, he will release a battle cry inspiring allies. Every second that the Champion either deals or receives damage, he gains a charge. After 20 charges have been gained, the Champion will automatically release his battle cry buffing the stats of nearby allies by 5% for 20 seconds. Charges will decay one per second if the Champion is out of combat for 10 seconds.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: 650 
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• While not an overly powerful skill it’s casted automatically without cost, buffs stats by % so it scales with any build, and applies to all allies in range making it increasingly useful in larger groups

Journeyman 1 – Herculean Roar (Channeled)
Effects: The Champion summons all the force inside himself and releases a long roar. Enemies within range suffer from reduced attack damage and increased damage taken while the ability is channelled, as well as for an equal amount of time after the channelling has ended. Allies in range are cleared of debuffs when the ability is cast. Can only be channelled for 10 seconds. (Channeling cannot be broken by enemy stuns.)
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 30 seconds
Range: 650
Cost: Average

Notes:
• Cannot knockback bosses, however it can be used to shield a Tank that's taking too much damage

Journeyman 2 – Intercepting Strike
Effects: The Champion leaps through the air towards an ally or enemy. If an enemy is targeted, or is within 100 units of a targeted ally, the Champion will land on the enemy dealing high damage and immobilizing them for 5 seconds. Targeted allies will also receive a 2 second damage absorbing shield.

Notes:
• A powerful single target DPS ability that gives the Champion magic damage.

Ultimate 2 - Invictus

Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: 20 seconds
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• A powerful passive that can also be activated to avoid incoming spike damage. An asset for both tanks and DPS.

Class Skill - Adrenaline
Effects: The Champion has become so accustomed to life and death situations that his body consistently administers adrenaline, and boosts the quantity even more as he suffers. Adrenaline gives the Champion of the Arena increased movement, increasing x2 critical chance, and increased [BASE] health regeneration.
Benefits From: N/A
Cooldown: N/A
Range: N/A
Cost: N/A

Notes:
• The exact functioning is as such: Rank 1 gives 3 movement, 3% critical chance and 3% bonus to BASE health regeneration at all times. Every 10% health missing adds a multiplier, so it would be:
(Health) 100-91% = Bonus (3)%, 90-81% = (3x2)%, 80-71% = (3x3)%, 70-61% = (3x4)%, 60-51% = (3x5)%, 50-41% = (3x6)%, 40-31% = (3x7)%, 30-21% = (3x8)%, 20-11% = (3x9)%, 10-0% = (3x10)%
• Adrenaline gets 1% BASE added every 4 ranks, so at Rank 8 it has a minimum of +5/5% bonus, and a maximum of +50/50% bonus. Keep in mind it’s a 50% bonus to the BASE Strength Health Regeneration. This means:
Given a hypothetical value of 0.1 regeneration per point of Strength, 3498 Str would give ~350 regen a second. If the Champion was at 9% health, he would regen ~525 a second. (IE. 175 free regen)
