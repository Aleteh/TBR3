- General Mechanics -
	Leveling: 		Spendable attribute points instead of skill levels.
	Creep spawning: OnTouch/OnTouchEnd that spawn set creeps at random locations that patrol to random waypoints.
	Max gold: 		Increase to 1 million.
	Experience: 	Increase XP accordingly while in a Party.
	Save/Load:		Provide a persisten RPG system that allows players to instantly load their current hero data, connected to their SteamID.
	
	Bank: 			Extra 6 slots to store items, items are saved. Only accessible in the city. Will need a custom storage system.
						> Units without Move capability can't drag items.
							Option 1: Putting the Bank unit on a place where it can't "escape".
							Option 2: Giving the Bank building 6 abilities, one to drop/eject/transfer each item.
							Option 3: Flash UI?

	Backpack:		Extra 6 slots that you can carry around, items are not saved. Could possibly reuse the default Stash, making it global.
						> If we make the default stash global, the shop would also also global.
						> Having a controllable unit with inventory is possible.

	Stats:			Custom Spell Power & Spell Healing. Every Heal & Damage spell is affected by it, 1:1 additively. Some spells use a custom multiplier of it.
	 				Assassin, Warlord, Barbarian and Khaos Champion doesn't benefit from spell power and healing power. Warrior Classes.
					INT = 15 mana, .01 MP per second, 3 Spell & Healing Power.
					STR = 20 HP and 0.25 hp per second regeneration.
					AGI = .2 armor, 1% IAS.
	Warrior Mana:  	Barbarians - gain their mana whenever they attack, also gains mana when attacked. Degenerates over time.
					Warlords   	- gain their mana whenever they attack. Regenerates slowly over time.
					Assassin/KC: - does not gain mana with each attack but quickly regenerates his mana naturally. 
	Skills:			Unlearneable normally, only through purchase/droppable Book system.
	Professions:	Complete Flash UI needed.
	Crating Mats: 	Custom resource.
	City Attacks:	Configured similar to holdout waves. Difficulty based on Average Hero level.
	Quests:			Will probably need a Flash UI, but the repeatable Kill-Quests can use the ingame system to start with.
	Item Restrict:	Automatically drop items that are not allowed to be carried by the hero. Restrictions are Level & Class.
	Item Sets:		Give bonuses when particular items are together in the player's inventory.
	Duel:			PvP! Change to Multi-Team settings.
	Divine Armor:	Divine armor takes only 10% dmg from all types of atacks. After this flat reduction of 90% the reduction from the armor value is also applied.
